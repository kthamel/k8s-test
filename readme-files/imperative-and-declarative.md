# Imperative approach
[Defining what to do and how to do]
[ie: create kubernetes resources using the kubectl command, not persist into the files.]

# Declarative approach
[Not specifing the step by step, just defining the final outcome]
[ie: create the defenition yaml files and execute the files, and persist into the files.]
